Dear Dad,

ðŸŽ‚ Happy Birthday! ðŸŽˆ

I noticed your Cursor subscription is about to expire...
Just like your youth! ðŸ˜‰

But don't worry - unlike your hairline,
this is something we can actually renew!

Here's to another year of:
- Debugging like a pro
- Pretending you understand AI
- Copying from Stack Overflow (we all do it!)

Love you, Dad! May your code be bug-free
and your error messages few.

P.S. This card was written by AI,
because even your kid is embracing the future! ðŸ¤– 

Happy Birthday Dad
Riley
